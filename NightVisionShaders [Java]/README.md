# Night Vision Shaders
A shaderpack/resourcepack that aims on giving brightness everywhere while keeping the game aesthetic. It 
makes the game brighter, so you see well in caves, in the nether, underwater and everywhere else. But it also
keeps slight light difference so that the aesthetic is not destroyed.

If you like this pack consider supporting the development by [buying me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/T6T41BS1C9).

### Enabling the resourcepack
You can simply enable it as resourcepack (Copy the `.zip` into the `resourcepack` directory).
If you are using Sodium or Iris, the [Sodium Core Shader Support](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium-core-shader-support) mod is required.
The pack does not work with Optifine!

### Features
While making the game brighter it also keeps the game aesthetic:
- fog is not completely removed, it just starts further away
- light sources still emit light
- blocks still cast shadow, but less dark
- it works with Sodium (requires [Sodium Core Shader Support](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium-core-shader-support) mod)
