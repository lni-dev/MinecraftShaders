Energy Shaders is a shaderpack/resourcepack that provides a more colorful vanilla expierience. Without requiring
any mods or a frame rate drop.

If you like this pack consider supporting the development by buying me a coffee:

### Features
It is best to take a look at the [gallery](https://modrinth.com/shader/energy-shaders-java/gallery) or to
try the shaderpack out. Here is a list of some features:
- Custom lightning (different for day, night and in caves)
- Custom fog (different for day, night and in caves)
- Custom Nether
- Custom End
- Custom torch light (different for day, night and in caves)
- Vignette effect

### Enabling the resourcepack
You can simply enable it as resourcepack (Copy the `.zip` into the `resourcepack` directory).
If you are using Sodium, the [Sodium Core Shader Support](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium-core-shader-support) mod is required.
The pack does not work with Optifine!

### Customization (WIP)
Energy Shaders also offers a lot of customization. Since this is a vanilla shader-pack, these settings have to be
manually edited. 

#### Getting started with customizing energy shaders
First download the [settings template](https://github.com/lni-dev/MinecraftShaders/raw/refs/heads/master/ES%20Java%20Settings/versions/v.%201.0.0/ES%20Java%20Settings.zip).
Then copy the downloaded zip file to your resourcepacks directory. You can find it by pressing `Open Resourcepacks Directory` in
Minecrafts Resourcepack selection screen. Next extract the zip file and delete it, so that only the extracted
directory `ES Settings Java` remains. You can rename the directory to your liking.

Now edit `ES Settings Java/pack.mcmeta`

They are located inside the `.zip` file in the file `assets/minecraft/shaders/include/es-settings.glsl`.

that vanilla Minecraft is very limited.
