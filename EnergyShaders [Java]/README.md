### Features
It is best to take a look at the [gallery](https://modrinth.com/shader/energy-shaders-java/gallery) or to
try the shaderpack out. Here is a list of some features:
- Custom lightning (different for day, night and in caves)
- Custom fog (different for day, night and in caves)
- Custom Nether
- Custom End
- Custom torch light (different for day, night and in caves)
- Vignette effect

### Enabling the resourcepack
You can simply enable it as resourcepack (Copy the `.zip` into the `resourcepack` directory).
If you are using Sodium, the [Sodium Core Shader Support](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium-core-shader-support) mod is required.
The pack does not work with Optifine!

### Customization
Energy Shaders also offers a lot of customization. Since this is a vanilla shader-pack, these settings have to be
manually edited. They are located inside the `.zip` file in the file `assets/minecraft/shaders/include/settings.glsl`.
